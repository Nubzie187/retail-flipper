# Retail Flipper — Report Viewer

A simple, read-only frontend viewer for CSV reports generated by the Retail Flipper tool.

## What This Is

This viewer allows non-technical testers to easily browse and filter deal reports without needing to open CSV files in Excel or other spreadsheet applications. It provides a clean, card-based interface with search, filtering, and sorting capabilities.

## How to Run

### Option A: Direct File Open
1. Navigate to the `viewer` folder
2. Double-click `index.html`
3. Note: Some browsers may block file loading due to CORS restrictions. If you see errors, use Option B instead.

### Option B: Local Server (Recommended)
1. Open a terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to the `viewer` directory:
   ```bash
   cd viewer
   ```
3. Start a local HTTP server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 5173
   ```
   (If you don't have Python, you can use Node.js: `npx http-server -p 5173`)
4. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

## What CSVs to Load

The viewer works with any CSV file, but is designed for these report types:

- **PASSED**: `data/reports/passed-YYYY-MM-DD.csv` — Items that passed all filters
- **NEARMISS**: `data/reports/nearmiss-YYYY-MM-DD.csv` — Items that were close to passing
- **ALL**: `data/reports/all-YYYY-MM-DD.csv` — All items processed

## Features

- **Tab-based organization**: Switch between PASSED, NEARMISS, and ALL datasets
- **Search**: Filter by title, brand, or category
- **Sorting**: Sort by Profit, ROI, Sold Comps, or Price
- **Category filtering**: Filter by specific category (if available in data)
- **Card view**: Clean, readable cards showing key metrics
- **Links**: Direct links to source URLs and eBay comparison pages

## Technical Details

- Uses PapaParse (via CDN) for CSV parsing
- Handles various column name variations automatically
- Defensive parsing: missing fields show as "—" instead of breaking
- Responsive design: works on desktop and mobile
- No build step required: plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
